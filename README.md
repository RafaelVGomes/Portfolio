# Portfolio

You'll notice that most materials, if not all of them, on this portfolio will lack sources like files, code lines, example.env, etc. I would like to make clear that the reason of that decision is due the professional nature of this repository and you'll be able to see an live example of the application hosted somewhere, like on heroku. Look for links on READ ME of each project or contact me through GitHub.

Thank you for your visit.

P.S.: Don't forget to take a look on "development" branches, ok?
